1.a.  (-1.5)
1.b.  (-1.5) incomplete

2.a.  Correct
2.b.  Correct

3.a.  Correct
3.b.  (-4) revised this so the avg is calculated in the same void function as the rest of the calculations
3.c.  Correct
3.d.  Correct
3.e.  Correct
3.f.  Correct

4.    (-6) total is the only one that changes due to the scope
	 in which it is declared being outside of the for loop,
	 whereas the for loopâ€™s scope contains that definition
	 of loopcount, while another loopcount, declared to 0,
	 remains in the outer scope. Thus, Loopcount == 0 and total == 10.

5.    Correct. No assumption about the indentation is necessary...
      look for braces to see which 'block' of code goes
      with a looping construct.  Review Chapters 6 and 7 Powerpoints
      for the rules.

6.    Correct
