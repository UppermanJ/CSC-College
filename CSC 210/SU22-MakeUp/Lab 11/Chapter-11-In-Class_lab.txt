This lab will exercise your understanding of some of the concepts covered in Chapter 11:  
  classes, inheritance
  
  
1. Design the class  patientType, inherited from class  persontype, with
   additional data members to store a patient's ID, age, date of birth,
   the date the patient was admitted in the hospital, and the date the patient was discharged.
   The data members must be private.
   
2. Add appropriate constructors and member functions to initialize, access and
   manipulate data members.  

3. Code a test program that creates a new patient.  Test the classes as follows:
   
   Create a patientType object.
   
   Request the patient ID, First Name, Last Name
   
   Set the values in the object appropriately
   
   The date of birth, admission date and discharge dates may be set using hard-coded values or requested.  
   Set these values for the patientType object
   
   Print the patientType object information: 
   
      First Name, Last Name, Admission Date, Discharge Date,
        Date of birth
   
Complete as much as you can before you leave ensuring what you've completed compiles.  These labs are 
entirely for your practice.

The program may be named any name of our choice and must have a .cpp extention; variables may be any name 
of your choice.

You DO NOT have to comment these programs, however, please include your NAME as a comment in ALL code files.

SUBMIT the code (*.cpp, *.h) and your project file (for Dev C++  is *.dev, for codeblocks it is *.cbp). 
All files must be submitted and the program MUST compile and run to get credit.  The project files do
not contain the code files, so please submit all files.

You MAY zip the files and submit the zipped files.

Questions will be entertained; solution will be discussed in class. This is a collaborative effort to provide examples
and practice for your understanding.
