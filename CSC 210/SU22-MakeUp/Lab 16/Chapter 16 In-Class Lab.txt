This lab will exercise your understanding of some of the concepts covered in Chapter 16:  
  vector object, sequential search, sorting
  
1.  Create a program that uses the Sequential Search Algorithm to search a STRING VECTOR OBJECT.

    You may begin with the Sequential search algorithm on slide 5 of the powerpoint lecture or implement 
    in your own way.
    
a.  Write the sequential search function using a vector.  Modify the search to search a sorted list.
    If the name is found, return the index of the name found. 

b.  Create a vector object and request a list of names from the user, first names are adequate.  
    Store the names in a string vector. Enter 8-10 names.
    
c.  Request a sentinel value to end the input sequence.

d.  Sort the vector list using one of the sort algorithms provided by the text (also in the Chapter 16
    powerpoint, slides 13 and 21, which can be copied/pasted)
    
e.  Request a search name from the user.  Remember, unless you account for case, the data will be case 
    sensitive.

f.  Call the sequential search function.

g.  Upon return from the search, display an appropriate message indicating whether the name was 
    or was not found.  If the name was found, output the index of the located name (you do not
    have to adjust for the zero-based index)


Complete as much as you can before you leave ensuring what you've completed compiles.  These labs are 
entirely for your practice.

The program may be named any name of our choice, must have a .cpp extention; variables may be any name of your
choice.

You DO NOT have to comment these programs, however, please include your NAME as a comment in ALL code files.

SUBMIT the code (*.cpp). All files must be submitted and the program MUST compile and run to get credit.

You MAY zip the files and submit the zipped files.

Questions will be entertained; solution will be discussed in class. This is a collaborative effort to provide examples
and practice for your understanding.
