This lab will exercise your understanding of some of the concepts covered in Chapter 7:  
  strings, enumerated types

Create a program that:

1.  Prompts the user to enter a string.

2.  Use ANY method you'd like to remove all the vowels from the string (string function substring,
    accessing the string characters as arrays, etc.), creating a new string.

3.  Output the new string with all the vowels removed.

4.  The program MUST contain two functions--

    (1) to remove all the vowels from the string, i.e., create a new string from the old string; 
    
    (2) to determine if a character is a vowel.
    
5.  Use an enumerated type to evaluate each character to determine if it is a vowel.  Hint:  Write the program
    WITHOUT the enumerated type first to get it working.
    
    
Complete as much as you can before you leave ensuring what you've completed compiles.  These labs are 
entirely for your practice.

The program may be named any name of our choice, must have a .cpp extention; variables may be any name of 
your choice.

You DO NOT have to comment these programs, however, please include your NAME as a comment in ALL code files.

SUBMIT the code (*.cpp). The program MUST compile and run to get credit.

You MAY zip the files and submit the zipped files.

Questions will be entertained; solution will be discussed in class. This is a collaborative effort to provide examples
and practice for your understanding.
