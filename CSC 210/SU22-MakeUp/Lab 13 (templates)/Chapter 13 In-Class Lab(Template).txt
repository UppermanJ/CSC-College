This lab will exercise your understanding of some of the concepts covered in Chapter 13:  
  templates
  
1.  Create a function (class) template prototype and definition named findLargest that has two parameters:

    a.  an array of Type
        
    b.  int representing size of the array
    
    c.  a return value of Type
    
    d.  the template code should loop through the array, find the largest value and return the largest value
    
    e.  create and initialize two arrays, an integer array and a double array, size and values
        of your choice
    
    f.  call the function template using each of the declared arrays and output the largest
        value in each of the arrays
        
Complete as much as you can before you leave ensuring what you've completed compiles.  These labs are 
entirely for your practice.

The program may be named any name of our choice, must have a .cpp extention; variables may be any name of 
your choice.

You DO NOT have to comment these programs, however, please include your NAME as a comment in ALL code files.

SUBMIT the code ( *.h and *.cpp) files and the project file (*.dev).   All files must be submitted and the 
program MUST compile and run to receive credit.

You MAY zip the files and submit the zipped files.

Questions will be entertained; solution will be discussed in class. This is a collaborative effort to provide 
examples and practice for your understanding.
