This lab will exercise your understanding of some of the concepts covered in Chapter 12:  
  pointers
  
Part I

1. Define int variables x and y and int* pointer variables p and q.  

   Assign x the value 2, y the value 8, set p to contain the address of x, and q to contain the address of y.
   
   Then output the following information, using appropriate messages:
   
   a. The address of x and the value of x.
   
   b. The value of p and the value of *p.
   
   c. The address of y and the value of y.
   
   d. The value of q and the value of *q.
   
   e. The address of p (not its contents!).
   
   f. The address of q (not its contents!).

Part II

2.  For the following, use the pointer notation ONLY. Do NOT use the array index [] notation.
    Define the variables below and write code which prints the characters in a c string in a reverse order.
     char s[10] = "abcde";
     char* cptr;
    
Complete as much as you can before you leave ensuring what you've completed compiles.  These labs are 
entirely for your practice.

The program may be named any name of our choice, must have a .cpp extention; variables may be any name 
of your choice.

You DO NOT have to comment these programs, however, please include your NAME as a comment in ALL code files.

SUBMIT the code (*.cpp). The program MUST compile and run to get credit.

You MAY zip the files and submit the zipped files.

Questions will be entertained; solution will be discussed in class. This is a collaborative effort to provide 
examples and practice for your understanding.
